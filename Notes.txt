Auth0 Implementation:
1. Navigate to Auth0.com
2. Setup the Callbacks (localhost: 3000)
3. Use Auth0 like you would use a customer AuthContext. 
4. .env file for secret info, add to gitignore and use prefix REACT_APP_ to make it work


Images in Database: 
 - Convert to base64 binary. 


Add and Delete of Products: 
- Adding and deleting the added product after each other does not work. The Added Product only gets a DB_ID when it is submitted/browser refresh. 
- When we add a product, it is added to the DB right away, but the browser does not refresh with each add. 
- Doing it this way helps the webpage to be more efficient.
