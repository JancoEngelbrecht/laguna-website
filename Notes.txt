Keep in Mind: 
1. Putting a login in a dropdown does not really work well. 

Auth0 Implementation:
1. Navigate to Auth0.com
2. Setup the Callbacks (localhost: 3000)
3. Use Auth0 like you would use a customer AuthContext. 
4. .env file for secret info, add to gitignore and use prefix REACT_APP_ to make it work

Auth0 Token API:
1. Testing should be created manually
2. Production should request via the API 

.env
1. Check that file is included in the backend and frontend file
2. Remove the git tracking if the .gitignore does not work. 

Images in Database: 
 - Convert to base64 binary. 

Add and Delete of Products: 
- Adding and deleting the added product after each other does not work. The Added Product only gets a DB_ID when it is submitted/browser refresh. 
- When we add a product, it is added to the DB right away, but the browser does not refresh with each add. 
- Doing it this way helps the webpage to be more efficient. 

Tailwind Installation: 
    1. Check that the path is correct in config file
    2. Check that the config file is in the root
    3. Check that the styles.css is imported into the index.js
    4. Check that the styles.css is in the src folder. 
    5. Confirm that the postcss config file is created
    6. Run the following in the terminal: npm install tailwindcss postcss postcss-loader css-loader style-loader --save-dev

Add a PayGate: 
- Customer would need to sign-up so that we can manage their products in the DB. 
- Use Product Component to add selected product to the DB. 
- The DB should be setup to handle for each user
