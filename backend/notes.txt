How to set up the Node server side: 

- Create Backend folder and navigate to it
- run "npm init -y" in terminal
- create index.js file in Backend folder
- in package.json, change the test to "node index.js", this way you can just use "npm start" in terminal. 
- Terminal "npm i express cors body-parser"
- Set up the index.js
- create a routes folder and a routes.js file

Setting up the Server - Index.js: 

Express -> Node.js Framework for webservers
Cors -> Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
    - Origin = URL
    - Without CORS i would not be able to access (.com) if i am working with (.co.za)
Body-parser -> Middleware to parse incoming request bodies into formats
    - Parse = Convert
Router - module containing routes for application (Paths inside of the Server)

REMEMBER: 
- npm install mongoose
- npm install dotenv
- npm install express
- npm nodemon (auto server restart when you make changes when running)
